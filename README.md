# Stimulize

## Purpose:
The goal of this program is to make a great discomfort something comfortable. The intent is to make *EE457 â€” Digital Integrated Circuits* easier by means of automating the process of toggling *IRSIM* inputs on *ELECTRIC*. Toggling inputs in *IRSIM* using the built in vecotr commands will not make the boxes, but using commands *h* and *l* will. This program acts as a wrapper to do that easily.

This program can of course also be used to generate command files for terminal *IRSIM*.

This program will take input arguments and can then be piped to *.cmd* file, which can be imported into
*ELECTRIC* by going to *TOOLS->Simulation (Built-in)->Restore Stimuli From Disk ..*

This program sets the analyzer window to the desired nodes you wish to track. Then, it generates a sequence of *IRSIM* commands to toggle a desired set of inputs **n** going through all **(2^n)-1** states. It can also generate *IRSIM* commands for particular test sequence of inputs instead.

The default mode is to scroll through inputs using **Gray Code**, changing only one bit at a time so the outputs are more stable. It will still toggle through all input combinations.

**Example 1:** If you have 3 inputs [ A, B, C ], the program will generate commands to toggle them from [ 0, 0, 0 ] to [ 1, 1, 1 ], in **Gray Code** order.

**Example 2:** If you have 4 inputs [ I1, I2, I3, I4 ], and you wish to test [ 0, 0, 0, 0 ] [ 1, 1, 1, 0 ], and [ 0, 0, 1, 1 ], it will generate commands for only those three as desired.

## Compile:
Clone the repository and run **make && make install** from the directory. Special thanks to
**Joseph** for this convenience. This will compile the program and link it to your **$PATH**, and install the man page
Depending on your system, *make install* may require administrative privileges.
This program may be maintained and updated on git. You can pull the changes, and re run the same commands to update your system.

    $ make && make install

To uninstall the program, run:

    $ make clean && make uninstall

## Man Page:
Upon runing **make install**, the man page should be copied to your local manpage directory. 
This program assume the directory is
    
    /usr/local/share/man/man1

If that is not the case, you will have to either adjsut your **$MANPATH** or change the make file.
If everything succeeds you can can now see examples and more detailed information using

    man stimulize

## Usage:

    $ stimulize -a {node_name ..} -v {node_name ..} [-s <step_val>] [-t {test_seq ..}]

### Required:

-a,--analyzer {node_name ..}: nodes to view on the analyzer window.

-v,--vector {node_name ..}: nodes to vectorize.

### Optional:

-s,--stepsize <step_val>: set the stepsize to <step_val>, default is 5ns.

-t,--test {test_seq ..}: binary sequences to toggle the vector, default is 0 to ( 2^n ) - 1.

## Examples:

**Example 1:** Stepsize: default - 5ns, View A,B,C,OUT in the analyzer, vectorize A,B,C as
input, and step through all combinations in Gray Code order.


    $ stimulize -a A B C OUT -v A B C

**Example 2:** Stepsize: 50ns, View [I0,I1,I2,I3,O0,O1]  in the analyzer, vectorize [I1,I2,I3,I4] as input, and test the specific cases 
[I0,I1,I2,I3] = [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,0] [0,0,1,1], [1,1,1,1]

Pipe the output to test.cmd

    $ stimulize -a I0 I1 I2 I3 O0 O1 -v I0 I1 I2 I3 -s 50  -t  0000  1110  0011 1111 > test.cmd

**Example 3:** see stimulize help

    $ stimulize -h
